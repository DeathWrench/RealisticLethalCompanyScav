# Realistic Scavengers
This mod adds the extra suits that were missing from the original [HighQualityScavlethalcompany](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/EliteScavs/HighQualityScavlethalcompany/) mod: 
Purple, Green, Pajamas, Hazard

## Instructions
- Place contents in `bepinex/plugins` folder. Ensure that ModelReplacementAPI is also installed. 
#### OR 
- Install with a mod manager like [r2modman](https://github.com/ebkr/r2modmanPlus/releases) or [Thunderstore Mod Manager](https://www.overwolf.com/oneapp/Thunderstore-Thunderstore_Mod_Manager)

### Benefits 
- When using mods like [LateCompany](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/anormaltwig/LateCompany) / [ShipLobby](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/tinyhoot/ShipLobby/) / [LetMeJoin](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Mont/LetMeJoin/), people who join will no longer be invisible.

### Downsides
- Masked enemies do not have the new model.
- Decapitations do not happen visually for you. Other players without this mod will still see them.

#### Some clipping when used with certain mods:
 - [FPSSpectate](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/5Bit/FPSSpectate/) 
 - [OpenBodyCams](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Zaggy1024/OpenBodyCams/)
 - [Helmet Cameras](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/RickArg/Helmet_Cameras/) 
 
 [OpenBodyCams](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Zaggy1024/OpenBodyCams/) has Model Replacement API Compatibility option, and an option to switch from headcam to a body cam which using either option seems to fix the clipping issue.
